# Password-Generator

# This React application is a Password Generator. Here's a summary of its functionality:

## Length Control:
The user can adjust the length of the password using a range input.
The minimum length is set to 8 characters, and the maximum is set to 50 characters.


## Character Selection:
The user can choose whether to include numbers and special characters in the generated password by toggling checkboxes.
If the "Numbers" checkbox is checked, numbers from 0 to 9 will be included in the generated password.
If the "Characters" checkbox is checked, a set of special characters (!@#$) will be included in the generated password.


## Password Generation:
Based on the user's selections, the application generates a random password.
It concatenates uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers (if selected), and special characters (if selected) to form the password.


## Copy to Clipboard:
After generating the password, the user can click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
The generated password is displayed in an input field that is read-only.


## UI Design:
The UI is designed using Tailwind CSS to provide a clean and responsive interface.
The application's title ("Password Generator") is displayed at the top.
Input controls (range input and checkboxes) are provided for adjusting password options.
The generated password is displayed in an input field along with a "Copy" button.
Overall, this application allows users to easily generate strong and customizable passwords for their use.
